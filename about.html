            I am Serge Iyamuremye. 
                I am a freshman at Trinity College CT, in Computer Engineering.
                I am an Administrative Assistant with eight years of experience 
                working alongside the executive team of a Fortune 500 company. 
                Serge specializes in administrative technology and is responsible for 
                educating other employees on using progressive systems and applications, 
                including accounting software, mass communication procedures and organizational 
                apps. Serge is a powerful force in the workplace and uses his positive attitude 
                and tireless energy to encourage others to work hard and succeed. 
                Serge is inspired daily by her wife and their two daughters. In her free time, 
                Serge likes to hike, crochet and play video games with his grandson."
